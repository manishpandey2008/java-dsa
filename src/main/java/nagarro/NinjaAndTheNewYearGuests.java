    Ninja And The New Year Guests
        Ninja has organized the new year party and invited all the programmers for it, as being the programmer also has been invited by Ninja.
        To detect whether the guest is a programmer or not, Ninja has set some tasks for them, such that only programmers can code them.
        You have also been asked to solve and code the following task to verify your identity.
        Given two integers, 'N' and 'K' find the number of permutation arrays of 'N' integers from 0 to 'N' - 1 satisfying the below condition.
        There should be at least 'K' positions in the array such that 'ARR[I] = I' ( 0 <= I < N ) satisfies.
        You are required to output the answer modulo 10^9 +7.
        EXAMPLE:
        Input: 'N' = 4 'K' = 3 Output: 1 There is only one permutation [0, 1, 2, 3] such that a number of elements with 'ARR[I] = I' is 'K' = 3.
